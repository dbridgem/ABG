Animated Bar Graph Generator (Because I'm bad at names)

Simple Python script to generate an animated bar graph based on a csv input. Script will autoscale (to a point, I've tried about 30 bars without too much trouble) based on size of csv. Options can be set in the csv input file.

To use just copy the Input.csv and main.py to a folder, modify the Input.csv, then execute main.py.

Packages needed:
pandas
numpy
PIL
os
opencv (cv2)
shitil
